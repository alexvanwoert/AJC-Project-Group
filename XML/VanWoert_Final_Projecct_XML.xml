        <sd>Before the curtain rises, Christinas chimes arc heard, playing distinctly,—“Christians,
            awake! Salute the happy morn, Whereon the Savior of mankind was born!* At the close of
            the chimes a pause of jo seconds absolute silence; after which there sounds shrill and
            clear a single stroke of a bell. The curtain rises, disclosing a room of a humble family
            of three children. “ The little Mother" is busy about the evening meal; Nannette is
            setting the table; Annikins, on the floor, cuts pictures for paper dolls.</sd>
        <dial speak="NANNETTE"><spk>NANNETTE</spk> What are the bells ringing for? </dial>
        <dial speak="HANNAH"><spk>HANNAH</spk> Why, don’t you know dear? They're ringing for the
            Christmas Child—for His birthday. This is Christmas Eve!</dial>
        <dial speak="ANNIKINS"><spk>ANNIKINS</spk> Is Christ Child coming here? </dial>
        <dial speak="HANNAH"><spk>HANNAH</spk>
            <sd>(Thoughtfully)</sd> Why yes, Annikins. He will come to us if we try to be kind and
            good. </dial>
        <dial speak="NANNETTE"><spk>NANNETTE</spk> Sister, can’t we possibly have a Christmas tree
            this year ? </dial>
        <dial speak="HANNAH"><spk>HANNAH</spk> I’m afraid not, deary. But we’ll try to be happy just
            the same. We’ll play “make believe’’ and make each other wonderful presents. It's lots
            of fun! And write letters to Daddy, and we’ll ask the Christ Child to bring Daddy safe
            home to us, and then mother will not have to work so hard down town. And we’ll ask the
            Christ Child to bring us sweet Peace and Good Will. Because lie is the Prince of Peace,
            and that’s what He is coming for. And then I s'pose we ought to pray for Democracy,
            ’cause that’s what Daddy is fighting for. </dial>
        <pn>2</pn>
        <dial speak="NANNETTE"><spk>NANNETTE</spk> What is Democracy? </dial>
        <dial speak="HANNAH"><spk>HANNAH</spk> I’m not sure I know, little sister. It’s kind of hard
            to understand. But it must be what the Christ Child wants every where in the world—for
            it means every body will be good and kind to every body and there'll not be any poor
            people who can’t get enough to eat, nor any unkind people who scorn and hate. Just all
            the world will love each other like you and I and Annikins love one another. Every body
            will be helping to make the world good and pleasant for every body else and so the
            Christ Child will come back to us again and He will be our Big Brother and all the
            people will be brothers ’cause you see they will all be His brothers. Come now Annikins,
            put away your paper dollies. Supper is ready. <sd>(She smoothes the child's hair,
                examines hands and face to see that they arc clean, and lifts her into a high-chair
                at the table. The others take their places and, with bowed heads and folded hands,
                sing the grace)</sd> — God is great and God is good, And we thank thee for this
            food; By thy hand must we be fed, Give us, Lord, our daily bread. Amen. </dial>

                The boys tc-car muffllers. Some have ice-skates hung over their shoulders. Two of
                the boys lug in a tree all ready to set up. The girls have their arms full of
                trinkets for the tree and presents for the children. They are bubbling over with
                spirits and gayly shouting,—“Merry Christmas Hannah! Merry Christmas Nanncttc!
                Hello, Annikins! Merry Christmas!" Their leader gives the child a bear-hug, and
                presents her with a wonderful doll, almost as big as the four-year-old herself. Nan
                net te gets a beautiful red dress and a string of beads. The children clap their
                hands in glee. While dressing the tree they sing.</sd>
