        <h2>Project Final Thoughts</h2>
        <h3>How To Begin</h3>
        <p>When we started to tackle this project, there were multiple questions we had to keep in
            mind. What coding languages would we use? How would we divide the work? Could we work
            well enough together to provide an outcome we could all be proud of? Any coding project
            can be daunting, but working in a team can add more stress. How can you make sure four
            brains are on the same track?</p>
        <h3>Our Process</h3>
        <p>Luckily for us four, our group seemed to mesh together very well. We started by using
            Alexander's foundation XML and schema of the base document to give us a platform to go
            from. After that, we each ran through the markup and edited tags and formations we
            thought could be improved or clarified. Working from there, we used XSLT to create an
            HTML web-page. We utilized a shared repository in GitHub where we could push up files we
            had edited and worked on, and pull other's completed work to our own personal files.
            Schemas and schematrons helped us to check that our work was functioning the way we
            wanted it to, and that nothing had been crossed between pushes and pulls. After we had
            the XSLT in place for our website, we then moved on to creating complimentary HTML and
            CSS pages to form our functioning website that you see here. </p>
        <h3>Choosing Languages</h3>
        <p>Choosing your coding languages for a project can be a complicated thing, because there
            are some you can't have without another. Each language we used in this project is
            intertwined with each other, creating a web that holds up our work and our website.
            Luckily for us, we had a brilliant professor who taught us the methods and tricks we
            needed to use along the way to succeed (thank you Dr. B, you really are the best).</p>
        <h3>Troubles Along the Way</h3>
        <p>Of course it all can't be sunshine and rainbows throughout a project, which we all
            realized quickly as we adjusted to working alongside others, and on a bigger scale than
            we were used to. There were a few instances where all four of us were pushing and
            pulling files at the same time and had a few hiccups with the code trying to consolidate
            the chages it was given. Luckily most of these problems happened while we were all on a
            zoom call together, and we were able to put our minds together to find bits and pieces
            that need to be changed or rearranged. Coding can be one of the most rewarding but also
            frustrating things you can do. For instance, Zak had an issue where he didn't specify
            XPATH enough, and overwrote the word "ANGELS" in a couple places with a link he was
            attempting to put into our document. These things can happen a lot easier than you'd
            think! We're still working on polishing up everything we want to accomplish with this
            project, and we're sure to make more mistakes on the way there, but we're all glad to be
            having the experiences and gaining the knowledge.</p>
        <h3>Still Under Construction</h3>
        <p>What you see now on our site isn't the full experience we're hoping to make it to by the
            end of finals week. We're going to work on fixing a few hiccups in the code, as well as
            adding some auditory links at the beginning of the play before lyrics to songs, so that
            you can get more of an experience. We plan to do more analysis on the document to show
            different data points, such as the ratio of male to female speakers. We also hope to add
            some analysis of the document itself, and what it could have meant to Anna Julia Cooper,
            and how her life affected her work.</p>
        <h3>What This Project Means to Us</h3>
        <p>Giving our time and effort to something that has a big visual to show for it has been
            extremely rewarding. It's an amazing thing to be able to physically see the output of
            your hard work. By working together, we were able to strengthen each otherâ€™s knowledge
            and accomplish far more than we each could have done individually. Our group stuck
            together and overcame a lot of different issues and errors that came about while we were
            working on our coding and website styling. Some of the members were more aware of how to
            work with XSLT and XPath, and some were better with CSS and HTML constraints. Due to
            this, we all were able to meet in the middle in some way with our contributions. We
            could not have pulled this off without each other, and we're all extremely proud of what
            we've accomplished together. We hope that you can see the time and love we've put into
            this project. Thank you!</p>
