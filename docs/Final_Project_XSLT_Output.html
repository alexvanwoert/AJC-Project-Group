         <div class="p"><em>Before the curtain rises, Christinas chimes arc heard, playing distinctly,—“Christians,
               awake! Salute the happy morn, Whereon the Savior of mankind was born!* At the close
               of
               the chimes a pause of jo seconds absolute silence; after which there sounds shrill
               and
               clear a single stroke of a bell. The curtain rises, disclosing a room of a humble
               family
               of three children. “ The little Mother" is busy about the evening meal; Nannette is
               setting the table; Annikins, on the floor, cuts pictures for paper dolls.</em></div>
         <div class="p">
            <p><u>NANNETTE:</u><br /> What are the bells ringing for? </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH:</u><br /> Why, don’t you know dear? They're ringing for the
               Christmas Child—for His birthday. This is Christmas Eve!</p>
            <p><u>ANNIKINS:</u><br /> Is Christ Child coming here? </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH:</u><br /> <em>(Thoughtfully)</em> Why yes, Annikins. He will
               come to us if we try to be kind and good. </p>
            <p><u>NANNETTE:</u><br /> Sister, can’t we possibly have a Christmas tree
               this year ? </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH:</u><br /> I’m afraid not, deary. But we’ll try to be happy
               just the same. We’ll play “make believe’’ and make each other wonderful presents.
               It's
               lots of fun! And write letters to Daddy, and we’ll ask the Christ Child to bring Daddy
               safe home to us, and then mother will not have to work so hard down town. And we’ll
               ask
               the Christ Child to bring us sweet Peace and Good Will. Because lie is the Prince
               of
               Peace, and that’s what He is coming for. And then I s'pose we ought to pray for
               Democracy, ’cause that’s what Daddy is fighting for. </p>
            <p><u>NANNETTE:</u><br /> What is Democracy? </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH:</u><br /> I’m not sure I know, little sister. It’s kind of
               hard to understand. But it must be what the Christ Child wants every where in the
               world—for it means every body will be good and kind to every body and there'll not
               be
               any poor people who can’t get enough to eat, nor any unkind people who scorn and hate.
               Just all the world will love each other like you and I and Annikins love one another.
               Every body will be helping to make the world good and pleasant for every body else
               and
               so the Christ Child will come back to us again and He will be our Big Brother and
               all
               the people will be brothers ’cause you see they will all be His brothers. Come now
               Annikins, put away your paper dollies. Supper is ready. <em>(She smoothes the child's
                  hair, examines hands and face to see that they arc clean, and lifts her into a
                  high-chair at the table. The others take their places and, with bowed heads and
                  folded hands, sing the grace)</em> — God is great and God is good, And we thank thee
               for this food; By thy hand must we be fed, Give us, Lord, our daily bread. Amen. </p>
            <p><u>ANNIKINS:</u><br /> Pass the sugar! <em>(correcting herself)</em>
               Excuse me sister, please pass the sugar! </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH:</u><br /> Oo-h Annikins! [Don't take quite so much, love!
               Uncle Sam says we can't have any more sugar till next month! </p>
            <p><u>ANNIKINS:</u><br /> <em>(Confidentially to her big sister)</em> you
               tell the Christmas Child / want some sugar,—hear? <em>(Carol singers are heard
                  outside)</em>3
               </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH:</u><br /> Hush, child, listen. It’s the carol singers! </p>
            <p><u>CAROL SINGERS:</u><br /> Christmas where children are hopeful
               and gay, Christmas where old men are patient and gray, Christmas with peace, like
               a dove
               in its flight, Over brave men in the thick of the fight. Everywhere, everywhere,
               Christmas tonight! Immediately after the carols the Sunshine Club come bursting in,
               covered with snow. The boys tc-car muffllers. Some have ice-skates hung over their
               shoulders. Two of the boys lug in a tree all ready to set up. The girls have their
               arms
               full of trinkets for the tree and presents for the children. They are bubbling over
               with
               spirits and gayly shouting,—“Merry Christmas Hannah! Merry Christmas Nanncttc! Hello,
               Annikins! Merry Christmas!" Their leader gives the child a bear-hug, and presents
               her
               with a wonderful doll, almost as big as the four-year-old herself. Nan net te gets
               a
               beautiful red dress and a string of beads. The children clap their hands in glee.
               While
               dressing the tree they sing. There’s a wonderful tree a wonderful tree The happy
               children rejoice to see. Spreading its branches year by year It comes from the forest
               to
               flourish here. Oh this beautiful tree with its branches wide Is always blooming at
               Christmas Tide; And a voice is telling its boughs among Of the Shepherds’ watch and
               the
               Angels’ song; Of a holv Babe in the manger low— The beautiful story of long ago— When
               a
               radiant star threw its beams so wide To herald the earliest Christmas Tide. <em>(Joining
                  hands, and singing, they dance around the tree)</em>
               </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH:</u><br /> <em>(A little shyly at first)</em> Oh thank you!
               Thank you so much girls. W hat a beautiful tree! Oh, we are so happy—I had no idea
               we
               would have a tree! </p>
            <p><u>1st SUNSHINE GIRL:</u><br /> <em>(Hanging a small doll on the
                  tree)</em> Here is a baby-doll for Annikins; skates for Xannette. And here, little
               Mother, is a gay peasant-kerchief and a picture storybook for you. I know you’ll read
               the stories to the rest. Hannah never keeps anything all for herself! </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH:</u><br /> <em>(Somewhat embarrassed)</em> Oh girls, I—I can’t
               tell you how much—Oh, I mean you are so good and kind—I just don’t know how to thank
               you. </p>
            <p><u>1st SUNSHINE GIRL:</u><br /> Oh don’t thank us at all, just
               thank the Christ Child! </p>
            <p><u>2nd SUNSHINE GIRL:</u><br /> All who love the Christ Child are
               trying to make little children happy tonight, don't you know? We don’t want a single
               child to be forgotten. His love will warm and cheer the loneliest child on earth.
               </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH:</u><br /> <em>(Thoughtfully)</em> Yes. All for the Christ
               Child who was born tonight. To love Him is to love all little children. </p>
            <p><u>SUNSHINE GIRLS:</u><br /> <em>(Putting on their wraps, waving
                  Merry Christmas to all; shaking hands affectionately with Hannah)</em>. Good night
               everybody! Be good children! Good night,—good night!</p>
            <p><u>THE CHILDREN:</u><br /> Good night! Merry Christmas! </p>
            <p><u>ANNIKINS:</u><br /> <em>(Piping up)</em> Au revoir-au revoir!
               <em>(Exit S.S. Club laughing and throwing kisses. A pause)</em></p>
            <p><u>NANNETTE:</u><br /> What a wonderful tree! <em>(They examine the
                  presents)</em>5</p>
            <p><u>HANNAH:</u><br /> <em>(Bustling to hide her emotion)</em> Come now
               <em>(takes Annikins by the hand)</em>. The Christ Child has sent us perfectly lovely
               friends and I am so glad you have your Christmas tree after a ll! Kneel down children.
               Annikins, put your hands together. <em>(They all kneel and repeat a prayer)</em> Oh holy
               Child of Bethlehem! Descend to us we pray; Cast out our sin and enter in. Be born
               in us
               today. We hear the Christmas angels The great glad tidings tell; Oh, come to us—Abide
               with us, Our Lord, Emanuel. <em>(During the prayer the stage is gradually darkened, so
                  that the children are no longer visible)</em>

            <p><u>CHRISTMAS ANNODOMINI:</u><br /> Two strokes of a bell.
               On the screen a still life night scene of the City of Bethlehem. Shepherds with flocks
               in the middle distance chorus by radio transcription: </p>
            <p><u>HYMN:</u><br /> 
               <em>(Chorus or transcription)</em> O little town of
               Bethlehem, How still we see thee lie! Above thy deep and dreamless sleep The silent
               stars go by; Yet in thy dark streets shineth The everlasting Light; The hopes and
               fears
               of all the years Are met in thee tonight. 6 For Christ is born of Mary, And
               gathered all above While mortals sleep, the angels keep Their watch of wondering love.
               O
               morning stars together Proclaim the holy birth, And praises sing to God the King And
               peace to men on earth! How silently, how silently The wondrous gift is given! So God
               imparts to human hearts The blessings of His heaven. No ear may hear his coming, But,
               in
               this world of sin, Where meek souls will receive Him, still The dear Christ enters
               in.</p>

               down,
               And glory shone around. “Fear not,” he said, for mighty dread Had seized their troubled
               mind; “Glad tidings of great joy I bring To you and all mankind.” <em>(A strong white
