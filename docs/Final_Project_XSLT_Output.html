      <section id="readingView"><br /><h2 id="C1"><a href="#H">SCENE I</a></h2>
         <div class="p"><em>Before the curtain rises, Christinas chimes arc heard, playing distinctly,—“Christians,
               awake! Salute the happy morn, Whereon the Savior of mankind was born!* At the close
               of
               the chimes a pause of jo seconds absolute silence; after which there sounds shrill
               and
               clear a single stroke of a bell. The curtain rises, disclosing a room of a humble
               family
               of three children. “ The little Mother" is busy about the evening meal; Nannette is
               setting the table; Annikins, on the floor, cuts pictures for paper dolls.</em></div>
         <div class="p">
            <p><u>NANNETTE</u>:<br /> What are the bells ringing for? </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH</u>:<br /> Why, don’t you know dear? They're ringing for the
               Christmas Child—for His birthday. This is Christmas Eve!</p>
            <p><u>ANNIKINS</u>:<br /> Is Christ Child coming here? </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH</u>:<br />
               <em>(Thoughtfully)</em> Why yes, Annikins. He will come to us if we try to be kind and
               good. </p>
            <p><u>NANNETTE</u>:<br /> Sister, can’t we possibly have a Christmas tree
               this year ? </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH</u>:<br /> I’m afraid not, deary. But we’ll try to be happy just
               the same. We’ll play “make believe’’ and make each other wonderful presents. It's
               lots
               of fun! And write letters to Daddy, and we’ll ask the Christ Child to bring Daddy
               safe
               home to us, and then mother will not have to work so hard down town. And we’ll ask
               the
               Christ Child to bring us sweet Peace and Good Will. Because lie is the Prince of Peace,
               and that’s what He is coming for. And then I s'pose we ought to pray for Democracy,
               ’cause that’s what Daddy is fighting for. </p>
            <p><u>NANNETTE</u>:<br /> What is Democracy? </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH</u>:<br /> I’m not sure I know, little sister. It’s kind of hard
               to understand. But it must be what the Christ Child wants every where in the world—for
               it means every body will be good and kind to every body and there'll not be any poor
               people who can’t get enough to eat, nor any unkind people who scorn and hate. Just
               all
               the world will love each other like you and I and Annikins love one another. Every
               body
               will be helping to make the world good and pleasant for every body else and so the
               Christ Child will come back to us again and He will be our Big Brother and all the
               people will be brothers ’cause you see they will all be His brothers. Come now Annikins,
               put away your paper dollies. Supper is ready. <em>(She smoothes the child's hair,
                  examines hands and face to see that they arc clean, and lifts her into a high-chair
                  at the table. The others take their places and, with bowed heads and folded hands,
                  sing the grace)</em> — God is great and God is good, And we thank thee for this
               food; By thy hand must we be fed, Give us, Lord, our daily bread. Amen. </p>
            <p><u>ANNIKINS</u>:<br /> Pass the sugar! <em>(correcting herself)</em>
               Excuse me sister, please pass the sugar! </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH</u>:<br /> Oo-h Annikins! [Don't take quite so much, love! Uncle
               Sam says we can't have any more sugar till next month! </p>
            <p><u>ANNIKINS</u>:<br />
               <em>(Confidentially to her big sister)</em> you tell the Christmas Child / want some
               sugar,—hear? <em>(Carol singers are heard outside)</em>3
               </p>
            <p><u>HANNAH</u>:<br /> Hush, child, listen. It’s the carol singers! </p>
            <p><u>CAROL SINGERS</u>:<br />
               Christmas where children are hopeful and gay,<br />
               Christmas where old men are patient and gray,<br />
               Christmas with peace, like a dove in its flight,<br />
               Over brave men in the thick of the fight.<br />
               Everywhere, everywhere, Christmas tonight!<br />
               <em>Immediately after the carols the Sunshine Club come bursting in, covered with snow.
                  The boys tc-car muffllers. Some have ice-skates hung over their shoulders. Two of
                  the boys lug in a tree all ready to set up. The girls have their arms full of
                  trinkets for the tree and presents for the children. They are bubbling over with
                  spirits and gayly shouting,—“Merry Christmas Hannah! Merry Christmas Nanncttc!
                  Hello, Annikins! Merry Christmas!" Their leader gives the child a bear-hug, and
                  presents her with a wonderful doll, almost as big as the four-year-old herself. Nan
                  net te gets a beautiful red dress and a string of beads. The children clap their
                  hands in glee. While dressing the tree they sing.</em>
               There’s a wonderful tree a wonderful tree<br />
                The happy children rejoice to see.<br />
               Spreading its branches year by year <br />
               It comes from the forest to flourish here.<br />
               Oh this beautiful tree with its branches wide Is always blooming
               at Christmas Tide;<br />
                And a voice is telling its boughs among<br />
               Of the Shepherds’ watch and the Angels’ song;<br />
               Of a holy Babe in the manger low— <br />
               The beautiful story of long ago—<br />
               When a radiant star threw its beams so wide <br />
               To herald the earliest Christmas Tide.<br />
               <em>(Joining hands, and singing, they dance around the tree)</em>

               <em>(Hanging a small doll on the tree)</em> Here is a baby-doll for Annikins; skates for
               Xannette. And here, little Mother, is a gay peasant-kerchief and a picture storybook
               for
               you. I know you’ll read the stories to the rest. Hannah never keeps anything all for
               herself! </p>

            <p><u>1st SUNSHINE GIRL</u>:<br /> Oh don’t thank us at all, just
               thank the Christ Child! </p>
            <p><u>2nd SUNSHINE GIRL</u>:<br /> All who love the Christ Child are
               trying to make little children happy tonight, don't you know? We don’t want a single
               child to be forgotten. His love will warm and cheer the loneliest child on earth.

            <p><u>HANNAH</u>:<br />
               <em>(Thoughtfully)</em> Yes. All for the Christ Child who was born tonight. To love Him
               is to love all little children. </p>

               The Christ Child has sent us perfectly lovely friends and I am so glad you have your
